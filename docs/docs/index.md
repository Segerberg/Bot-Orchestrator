# Bot-Orchestrator 

Bot-Orchestrator is a suite that offers the following resources to research programs wanting to study networks in laboratory experiments:

* The application allows researchers to add bots to a video conference to increase the perceived number of participants in a test session. 
* Individual bots can send text messages via a chat function during the video conference. 
* research programs can manipulate the current messaging feature to induce psychological variables or create different social situations of interest.

The Bot-Orchestrator software was developed by [Andreas Segerberg](https://github.com/Segerberg) for use in research funded by the United States High-Value Detainee Interrogation Group Contract 15F06720C0002022 awarded to [David Neequaye](https://www.gu.se/om-universitetet/hitta-person/davidneequaye) and the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/psykologi).
